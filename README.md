# InventoryManagementSystem_project
RPR Project - 2023

This Project is part of the course RPR at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo

An Inventory Management System (IMS) is a software application used to manage the inventory of products and materials within a company or organization - Grocery Store. IMS enables companies to track and manage their inventory, from tracking stock quantities to managing orders and deliveries.
IMS is an important tool for companies that have significant quantities of products and materials to track and manage. With the right IMS, a company can save time and money, increase efficiency and improve the quality of its products or services.

The project is designed so that the employer has the opportunity to log in with his data and add products. Products can be divided by category and brand, after which they can be edited, deleted and searched. Each product has its own name, price, bar code, quantity, description.
There is also a section representing the cash register, where products can be entered using a barcode or name, their price is added up and an invoice is issued after the order is completed.
