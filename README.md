# InventoryManagementSystem_project

This project is part of the RPR course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Sarajevo. The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a software application designed to help manage the inventory of products and materials in a company, specifically a grocery store.

With this IMS, companies can track and manage their inventory, from tracking stock quantities to managing orders and deliveries. This tool is essential for companies that deal with significant quantities of products and materials to keep track of their inventory. It can help them save time and money, increase efficiency, and improve the quality of their products or services.

The project allows employers to log in with their data and add products, which can be categorized by brand and category. The products can also be edited, deleted, and searched for easily. Each product is assigned a name, price, barcode, quantity, and description.

The IMS also includes a cash register section, where products can be scanned using a barcode or entered by name. The price of the products is automatically calculated, and an invoice is issued after the order is completed.

This project is an excellent example of how technology can be used to improve inventory management, reduce errors, and streamline the workflow of a grocery store. We hope that this IMS will be useful for companies that need to manage their inventory effectively. If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
